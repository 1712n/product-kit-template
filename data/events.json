    "eventSummary": "Bridge hacks accounted for 69% of all stolen crypto funds in 2022, totaling nearly $2 billion. These bridges, like Force Bridge, are vulnerable due to complex smart contracts and multi-signature wallets, with increased complexity leading to more potential bugs. State-sponsored groups, such as the Lazarus Group, have been linked to high-profile bridge hacks, including the $620 million Ronin network breach."
